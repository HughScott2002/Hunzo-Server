Recommendations for a complete security architecture:

Multi-Layer Security:

API Gateway (NGINX/Kong) for rate limiting, basic auth
Service Mesh (Istio) for service-to-service authentication
Application-level authentication middleware
AWS WAF for additional protection

Token Management:

Short-lived JWTs for API access
Refresh tokens for session management
Token revocation capability

Infrastructure Security:

yamlCopy# Example Kubernetes Network Policy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
name: wallet-service-policy
spec:
podSelector:
matchLabels:
app: wallet-service
policyTypes:

- Ingress
- Egress
  ingress:
- from:
  - podSelector:
    matchLabels:
    app: users-service
    ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 8080

Monitoring and Logging:

Centralized logging (ELK Stack)
Security event monitoring
Anomaly detection

Compliance:

Audit logging
Data encryption at rest and in transit
Regular security scanning

This approach provides:

Defense in depth
Scalable security
Consistent security across services
Compliance requirements
Monitoring and alerting
Easy integration with cloud services
